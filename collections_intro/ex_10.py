# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order.
# Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# This code will not print in alphabetical order because it is a set. Sets are unordered collections.
# The curly braces {} designate this collection of elements as a set rather than a sequence []
