# Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to the list's length? For example:

#       0    1    2
foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(foo[3])     # will this result in an error?

# attempting to access an index greater than or equal to the lists length will result in an IndexError
