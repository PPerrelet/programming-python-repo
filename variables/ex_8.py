# Challenge: This program uses a bit of math. Don't let that scare you away -- try it anyway.
# Assume you have $1,000.00 in the bank, and you've somehow managed to find a bank that pays you 5%
# (this is a wish-fulfillment fantasy) compounded interest every year. After one year, you will have $1,050
# ($1,000 times 1.05). After two years, you will have $1,050 times 1.05, or $1102.50. Create a variable named
# balance that contains the amount of money you will have after 5 years, then print the result. Use a single
# expression if you can to set balance to the correct value.

balance = (1000.00 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05
                   * 1.05 * 1.05)
print(balance)

balance_2 = 1000.00 # bank balance variable
INTEREST = 1.05  # constant interest

print('Please enter how many years.')
years =float(input())
 
while years > 0:
    print(balance_2 * INTEREST)
    years = years - 1
    balance_2 = balance_2 * INTEREST
